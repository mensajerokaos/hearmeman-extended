## Final Approval

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Bead ID** | runpod-ma-27 |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Status** | READY FOR RESEARCH |
| **Plan Version** | v1.0 |
| **Complexity** | Medium (4 research steps) |

## Summary

Research MiniMax MCP integration for vision/image analysis capabilities and produce actionable recommendation.

## Research Steps

### Step 1: Documentation Review
- WebFetch official MiniMax API docs
- WebSearch for vision capabilities
- Check existing MCP configuration

### Step 2: Capability Analysis
- Direct API test with image input
- Baseline measurement vs Qwen3-VL
- Rate limits and constraints

### Step 3: Cost & Viability Assessment
- Cost comparison table
- Weighted decision framework
- Risk assessment matrix

### Step 4: Recommendation
- GO / CONDITIONAL / NO-GO decision
- Implementation requirements if viable
- PRD creation if HIGH viability

## Deliverables

1. Research Summary (1-page executive)
2. Viability Assessment (detailed capabilities)
3. Cost Analysis (comparison table)
4. Implementation Plan (if viable)
5. Decision Report (GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO)

## Decision Framework

| Criterion | Weight | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Vision capability | 30% | _/5 |
| Cost per image | 25% | _/5 |
| Latency | 20% | _/5 |
| Documentation | 10% | _/5 |
| Integration ease | 10% | _/5 |
| Stability | 5% | _/5 |

**Thresholds:**
- GO: >= 4.0 AND vision confirmed
- CONDITIONAL: 3.0-3.9
- NO-GO: < 3.0
